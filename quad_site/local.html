            <p class="details">"Well, the reason I ended up at Princeton is because it was less expensive than MIT (haha). When I was a sophomore, I was friends with Elizabeth and Mary and we were deciding which eating club to join. We were between Colo and Quad…we were eating at Colo when we decided to sign into Quad (haha) because we were looking for a place where we could meet new people and make friends. As a junior, I took a gap semester in the fall and came back to a bunch of new people as part of my friend group, but they turned out to be pretty cool. It was strange at first missing so much, but I have the habit of bouncing around places so I am kinda used to it. I went to 4 different high schools and have lived in North Carolina, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and California…That’s why I am so latched to the idea of NYC as a concept. I want to stay somewhere for a long time, somewhere where I am connected to the people and the place. I hated NYC before I came here because I had a fear of rats, but after working there for a summer, I realized that it is so fun! So many things to do, I can walk everywhere, and so many young people."</p>

            <p class="details">“I’m an astrophysics major and next year I will be starting my PhD in astronomy at Northwestern. I have always liked STEM and research is pretty cool, which is how I’ve ended up here. My career goal is to become a professor in astronomy so I can teach science and give that access to others. Notably, I am aware that the PhD to professor conversion rate it not great (nervous laughter) so I am open to careers in Data Science as well. My dad is also a professor so he influenced me to follow this path…he jokes that having tenure means you can do whatever you want. I don’t know how true it is but I guess I would like to find it haha.”</p>
