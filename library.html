    <h1>mary's personal library </h1>
    <h3> <i>important books from formative periods of my life by school level</i></h3>
    <i>
        i have always been a reader. i am a visual learner and when i read, i watch the story unfold in my head. i think that's what makes me enjoy the experience so much. 
        as i have gotten older, i have become more busy and have strayed away from reading as a hobby, but i always make my way back. this library is a showcase of some of 
        the books i remember and enjoyed the most as i have grown.

                <li><b>Henry and Mudge.</b> I remember sitting in my sister's bed next to my mom, reading out loud. I was so proud to go from level 0 to level 1 Henry and Mudge books.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Fairy Realm.</b> I memorized where to find these books on the library bookshelf. Every time I finished one, I would beg my mom to bring me to the library to get the next one. Magical and fantastical.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Diary of a Wimpy Kid.</b> These books made reading easy and funny. My little brother is also named Manny, so I enjoyed the personification of a devious little brother named Manny.  </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Double Identity.</b> One of the many Margaret Peterson Haddix mystery books I enjoyed in later elemenary school. </li>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Percy Jackson.</b> I read this book for class in 6th grade and it altered the course of my life in middle school. I read all of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series and Heroes of Olympus series. I think I had a crush on Percy Jackson. I know that he is not real.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Divergent.</b> This book introduced me to the dystopian genre. I read so many dystopian series after this, I can't count...</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>The Fault in Our Stars.</b> I was emotionally attached to these characters. I cried a lot. Whenever I wanted to feel emotional, I would pick it off my bookshelf and read it again. </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>I'll Give You the Sun.</b> This book follows twins as they grow up, grow apart, and come back together in the end. I was deeply invested. It was also one of the first gay relationships I read about, just as I was forming my ideas about the world and how things should be.</li>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Small Great Things.</b> After reading this book, I read five other Jodi Picoult novels. Each one was as heart-breaking and thought-provoking as the previous one. I liked that the books were written from multiple perspectives, allowing me to get into the minds of others I could not understand.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Throne of Glass.</b> Although my favorite genre changed from fantasy to realistic fiction, this series was engaging, emotional, and complex. I don't even remember how long it took me to get through them all but I did.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Perks of Being a Wallflower.</b> I read this in middle school but I didn't fully understand it until I reread it years later. One of my most reread books. </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Little Fires Everywhere.</b> This book was a summer reading book but became my favorite. It made me reflect on things I had the privilege to never have thought about. What kind of barbies did you play with as a child? Did they look like you? </li>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Normal People.</b> Reading sad books about regular people helps me work through my own experiences. The unique dialogue style really intrigued me and took a while to get used to. I didn't know what to do after I finished. Have you ever had an experience like that?</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Less.</b> I found it hard at first to become invested. I like characters I relate to, and a 49 year-old gay man worrying about the death of his youth did not particularly resonate with me. However, I loved it and had so much fun watching the main character grow.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow.</b> At first, I enjoyed reading about characters working on CS stuff like me. I didn't know what I was in for. This book follows two friends through ups and downs in their life and friendship. Heartbreaking. I was destroyed by the end.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Circe.</b> I bought this book two years before I finished. Me and Circe were friends by the end. Although the story of Circe is thousands of years old, it felt new. A goddess who least enjoyed her divinity.</li>
